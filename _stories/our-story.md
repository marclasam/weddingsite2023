## Our Story

"Marc and Tarah's love story is like a sweet melody that began in 2018 at Concentrix. Marc, the Network Engineer, and Tarah, the Internal IT for Pomeroy, found their hearts connecting from across the room. Marc couldn't help but be drawn to Tarah's charm.

As fate would have it, their paths crossed when Marc faced some technical troubles with MS Outlook and Finesse, and Tarah, the IT wizard, came to his rescue. It was in those moments that their friendship blossomed.

Marc's fondness for Tarah went beyond the office. He eagerly waited for her after work, surprising her with Halaya (Ube Jam). He even went the extra mile, picking her up at 4 am to ensure she safely made it to work in Makati.

In just one month, they realized they wanted to spend their lives together, setting the date for their dream wedding on 11-23-23. They had their own wedding hashtag ready, highlighting their shared dreams and vision.

Their love journey led them to cohabitate in April 2019. Fast forward to 2021, they welcomed a beautiful baby into their lives, and in March 2023, they took the next step and got engaged.

To all those who have witnessed their love story, we are grateful to have you by our side, supporting us then, now, and forever. - Tawwy and Marc ‚ù§"
