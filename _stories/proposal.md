### The proposal

Marc had been eagerly planning to propose long before their dream date of November 23, 2023. However, due to the challenges brought about by Covid and the lockdown in 2020, they experienced a slight delay in their plans. During this time, the couple welcomed a precious addition to their family, a beautiful little girl named Aoife Marceline. While the pregnancy presented some financial difficulties, especially with two other girls to care for, Marc was determined to make everything perfect.

As soon as Marc got back on his feet and sorted out their finances, he wasted no time and reached out to a close friend to create a unique engagement ring. Marc's love for Tarah was boundless, and he wanted this proposal to be nothing short of extraordinary. Originally, he had planned to pop the question at the restaurant where they had their very first fancy date, Ninyo's Fusion Cuisine. Fortunately, he had a backup plan in mind, as he discovered that another couple intended to get engaged at the same restaurant on the exact day he had in mind, March 23, 2022.

So, they gathered their children and decided to head to a hotel in Ortigas. Little did Tarah know that the kids and their caretakers were all part of the plan. Marc had even gone to great lengths to assemble a team that would transform a room in Linden Suites, the very same hotel where they had celebrated New Year together. The hotel staff, upon learning of his proposal plans, graciously upgraded their room to a premium suite.

When Tarah entered the room, she was met with a breathtaking sight â€“ it was adorned with pink balloons, delicate candles, and an abundance of flowers. The proposal was an intimate affair, with only the two of them present. Tarah was initially taken aback, thinking it might be a joke due to the excitement pulsing through her heart. But she soon realized that this was a moment of pure love, and her answer was a resounding and beautiful YES.
